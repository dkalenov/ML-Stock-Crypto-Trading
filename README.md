## Unsupervised Learning:
1) Hidden Markov Model for Market Regimes
2) Clustering (KMeans, AgglomerativeClustering, DBSCAN)
3) Principle Component Analysis (Dimensionality Reduction)

## Supervised Learning:
1) Bitcoin Price Move Prediction (test: f1 score 0.67)
2) Deep Learning Binary Classification (acc 0.5, needs improvement)
3) Deep Learning Sequential Data (so far the model demonstrates low predictive ability)

## Reinforcement:
1) Environment Building stage
