        "The VIX is a measure of the implied volatility for the S&P500. The higher the \"Close\" of the VIX, the higher the uncertainty in the market. Fortunately, there are ways of capitlizing on the predictability of the VIX. Being able to predict implied volatility for the market with any degree of certainty better than 50/50 can give an options trader of ETF trader (VIX tracking ETF's) an edge.\n",

        "There could be many, many features that impact whether a stock price goes up or down. Predicting directionality for stocks, the VIX, commodities, FX etc represents a huge potential gain for every small percentage increment in forecast ability.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, having so many features allows room for noise and can create adverse impacts to your supervised learning. Therefore, we will explore deplying PCA (Principle Component Analysis) as a tool to find useful information within a vast array of indicators and features to help with our supervised learning later on.\n",
        "\n",
        "PCA can equally be extremely good at helping to understand correlations too and further study on PCS (based on articles and papers below) is encorouged."
